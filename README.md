# reminder

 Hi 
 I tried implementing uncle bobs clean architecture (I personally think it's the most important aspect) in this project 
 there is a feature folder which contains all features of the app and 
 every feature has data layer, domain layer and presentation layer
 we can implement desired design pattern in presentation layer... 

note : some features are missing due to my time limits

missing features: 
notifications are not implemented 
after creating an event it is not displayed
error messages and success messages are not displayed 
UI is kind of ugly 
I did not write any unit tests but as you can see it would be easy in this structure 

let me know if you have any questions
